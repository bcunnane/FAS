### Visualizing strain, strain rate, and muscle fiber direction.

This project utilizes strain and strain rate data collected in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle and seeks to align them in the direction of the muscle fibers as deterined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 

The first step is to display the directions of the strain, strain rate, muscle fibers. This is accomplished by displaying the eigenvectors of each as a truecolor image for the following directions with respect to the subject:

Red  - left to right  
Green  - anterior to posterior  
Blue  - superior to inferior

Each frame is shown in a montage image.
